Earlier this week, **Ashley Bennett** was elected as **Secretary and Director of Marketing** for the Heartland Transpersonal Alliance.

Ashley brings experience in marketing, graphic design, and digital outreach. Her work will support stronger community engagement and growth, especially across HTA's initiatives and partner organizations.

With this change, **Dr. Christine Ziemer** transitioned to the role of **Executive Director**. In this role, she continues working closely with **Dale Morgan**, President, on strategy and organizational operations.

This marks an important step for HTA as we expand leadership capacity and continue building responsible, community-centered programming.

We are actively seeking additional board members. Visit [board details](../../board/) to learn more and [board application](../../board-app/) to apply.
